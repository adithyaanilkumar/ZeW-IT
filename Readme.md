# About ZeW-IT
 The world is sinking into the sea of waste. Every narrow nooks and corner of the streets are being piled up with waste.Currently, there is no system of automatic waste segregation or collection implemented at the commercial level.Also, no such system exits whose purpose is to collect, segregate, manage waste as well as monitoring the whole process with minimum space and that is capable of being implemented in the general public. 
 
 **ZeW-IT**  is capable of doing all the above mentioned tasks. Our invention is an IoT based automatic waste segregation and management system. This is specifically a waste collection and management bin which is capable of automatically collecting and segregating up to 6 different types of waste namely organic, plastic, e-waste, metallic, glass and paper. The bin automatically segregates the waste put into it. 
 
 It Converts biowaste to manure. The bin uses the converted manure and implants a seed , makes a pellet and gives it as a reward to the user. The bin also measures the live status of the compartments, alerts the driver when the bin is full using an android application and sets the easiest route for the collection of the waste by the driver. The consumer using an application can get reward points by dumping waste into our bin which can be redeemed for public transport tor any other commercial purpose. Also, he is able to navigate to the nearest bin by using this application and also view the status of the individual compartments. 
 
**ZeW-IT** is fully automated and hence the user doesn’t need to worry about the selection of the type of waste that he puts into the bin. The bin **automatically** detects the type of waste and puts it into the corresponding compartment. This is done using artificial intelligence with an accuracy of **98%**. There is also a proper monitoring and reporting system within the app.

# WORKING METHOD

As mentioned above, this is an IoT based automatic waste segregation, collection and, management system in the form of a smart bin. 
+ The bin has 6 hexagonal shaped individual modular compartments in which 6 different types of waste can be put ergonomically. 
+ The compartments are attached to a shaft which is in turn attached to a Stepper motor. 
+ When the user comes to dumps the waste, it activates the sensing module consisting of a camera, ultrasonic, capacitive, inductive and IR sensor and the sensors detect the type of waste using a novel algorithm using a combination of image recognition using artificial intelligence and the array of physical sensors.
+ Then the system turns the detected category bin to the opening and the waste is dumped in that compartment. 
+ After the waste is dumped the bin asks if the user wants a reward. 
+ The Biowaste compartment of the bin contains a mixture of manuring agents along with a high torque motor which churns the biowaste and is converted into manure in this process. 
+ During this conversion process, biochemical energy is released which is collected and stored. The converted manure is taken and rolled into pellets in which an agricultural seed is implanted using a novel compression module. 
+ This Eco pellet is given as a reward to every user of the bin for dumping the waste. There is another option to claim the reward in terms of reward points which are calculated based on the amount and type of waste dumped by the user.After this an array of ultrasonic sensors located over each compartment measures the levels of each bin . 
+ The users are provided with an RFID card which they can scan over the RFID reader placed on the bin. The system then measures the level and type of waste he has put and calculates the reward points required to give out. The system gets the users name, collected points from the online server-side database and updates it with the current points he has earned. After this process is completed the GPRS module collects the location of the bins along with the data from the ultrasonic sensor and updates it to the server. 
+ There are two novel mobile applications for the public as well as administrators.
+ The public app requires the user to login with his username/card number and password. It will display the reward points he has earned and will allow the person to redeem these points for various services like credits for public transport etc. 
+ The user app has an option to locate the nearest bin along with the  live status of the individual compartments along with the drivers phone number and an opinion to navigate to the nearest bin which is not full. These data are collected from the server. There are also two other options to report a problem to higher authorities and to call the driver. 
+ The system send an alert to the drivers app when any of the compartments are full using a novel algorithm. The drivers app will set the easiest and shortest route to the bins which are full. It also allows the drivers to monitor the live status of the bins. 
+ The authorities can analyze the data received from the bins to analyse  waste dumpage through a server-side analysation algorithm. The algorithm plots different usage and levels of waste collected over a period of time in a graph and also provides options for additional analysis. The whole bin is powered by solar panels and a battery which gets recharged by these solar panels. When there more power generated than required, the system shifts the power to the grid. 

The bin is also autonomous and can arrive at the users house by calling it from the app using a combination of artificially intelligent object detection and avoidance and ultra and IR sensors guided with GPRS. The user just needs to summon the bin using the app. Our innovative, economical and modular bin is eco-friendly and useful to individual houses , colonies and industries and most importantly the public.
